### experimenting
a script that creates some points, then draws a fitted spline from the points, then draws a line to connect the starting
and ending poins of the spline (to create a closed figure).

Nexts, it extrudes the profile of the figure into a body.

### points_from_file:
A simple script that 1st draws a circle on the sketch and then reads x, y coordinates in from a file and creates POINTS
on the sketch.

### NewScript__3
Empty Fusion 360 skeleton script.

### mmc_cycloid_gear_gen
this is a script that creates a cycloidal gear, but does not provide all the necessary bodies.
